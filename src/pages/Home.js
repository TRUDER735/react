          <p> Huh, I beat the back out the bitchI walk in barefoot like Rick This not the time to confess
            Sleep with two phones on my chestYesterday, I was just broke, today, I look sexy and blessed Every time I come back home, baby girl kiss on my neck
            These girls keep calling me handsome, flew out to England and I'm with Lil Mexico Cropping that bitch out my pic' because she too thick, she must be a messy ho (Yeah, yeah)
            Put that on my kids I'm tired of the boogers, these big protein boogers, get that weak shit out of my face
            I gotta be honest, I cannot be happy unless my whole team get a taste
            NDA rent, cancel your ass yesterday 'cause a nigga gon' die 'bout respect, huh </p>
